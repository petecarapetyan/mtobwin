# Pull Model

This isn't the latest, for example it doesn't even allude to the assumption that dodging pushed products and services will leave most of your money in your pockets because most products and services we buy are pretty nearly commoditized, by now.

But it's a start. And I'm too lazy to keep working on this, now.

## **The Pull Model – A Personal Mode of Engagement**

### **Core Idea**

The *pull model* is a personal posture:

> To engage with goods, services, and opportunities **only by choice, on your terms**, and never by pressure, manipulation, or impulse.

It is a **mode of selection**, not a rule about what can be selected.

---

### **Guiding Principle**

> **Pull, don’t be pushed.**
> That’s it. The pull model doesn’t forbid new, expensive, experimental, or indulgent choices — it only says: *choose them because you want them, not because someone made you feel you should.*

---

### **Pull vs Push – Mode, Not Product**

| Aspect               | Pull model                              | Push model                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initiation**       | You initiate the desire or interest    | External forces initiate it (ads, trends, peers)           |
| **Timing**           | On your schedule                       | On theirs (“limited time,” “new drop,” “early access”)     |
| **Reasoning**        | Internally grounded (need, curiosity)  | Externally triggered (fear of missing out, image, urgency) |
| **Product Maturity** | May be new or mature                   | Often new, by design                                       |
| **Cost Sensitivity** | Often values low cost, but not rigidly | Cost often hidden or inflated                              |

### **Why It Matters**

In a world optimized for grabbing your attention and engineering your behavior, the pull model is:

* **A cognitive shield** against coercion and distraction
* **A reassertion of agency** over one's own needs and rhythms
* **A low-friction life filter** for living deliberately, not defensively

---

### **What the Pull model Is *Not***

* It’s *not* an allegiance to only cheap or old things
* It’s *not* a rejection of marketing as inherently bad
* It’s *not* a moral or ascetic discipline
* It’s *not* about saying “no” — it’s about saying **“yes, but only when I ask for it.”**

---

### **In Practice**

* You *can* buy the newest phone — because *you* went looking, not because a banner ad popped up
* You *can* subscribe to a new service — because *you* were curious, not because they offered 50% off if you “act now”
* You *can* explore experimental ideas — because *you* were pulled by your interest, not pushed by market hype

---

### **Closing Summary**

> **Pull model is about preserving sovereignty in a world optimized for manipulation.**
> You still get to want what you want. You just make sure it’s **your want**, not theirs.
